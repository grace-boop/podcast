You've been thinking about starting your podcast even upsetting about the idea for months and years. You've been procrastinating it or you're overwhelmed by all the different technical stuff that goes into starting a podcast well and it will show you the four different ways. You can start your podcast appears here. Hey, welcome to the Pod Town School. I'm Studio Steve coaches podcast producers and we've helped dozens of clients and hundreds of students to get some really amazing results, their podcast. And we want to do the same for you. In this video. We're going to show you the four different ways. You can start your podcast from the very basic to a professional level. And we're going to show you also the process and cons of each option. By the end of this video. You're going to know everything you need to know in order to start your podcast today. We are going to cover a lot in this video. So make sure you stick around until the end. And for those of you who like to skip ahead, we left them, time stamps in the description below. Each of the topics will be covering. How do we get the audio files from our phones? Or computers, all the way up to Google podcast. Apple podcasts on Spotify about podcasting is that the podcast directories, like Apple, and Google and Spotify. They don't actually hold your MP3 file. Actually need to upload your MP3 file to would call the podcast host MP3, your episodes, all the information regarding your podcast, lore podcast, cover art and your episode. I work actually a screenshot of us uploading, one of our Pottstown School podcast episodes to our podcast host simplecast. We add a title yet, episode description, some episode artwork and some keywords. Once we update it, here. It is. Updated to all of the podcast directories via something called an RSS feed. Once you have at least one episode. You can distribute a Dr. Podcast to the different podcast directories using this RSS link. This link will go to the different podcast directories and it will automatically update your podcast every time you post a new episodes. So hopefully that helps the whole thing. Makes sense to you a little bit more. Don't worry? Just get a podcast host and it'll all make sense. As you start up, loading episodes, and before we get into the four, Ways that you can start your podcast today? Because we're podcast coaches. We couldn't let you just jump into starting a podcast without at least sharing three really important tips that you keep in mind before starting a podcast cuz we want to said you have for success to take. Number one would be to do a preliminary name check. You don't want to use the same name that all the podcast out of using, he want to be original. And also, you want your name to be easy to spell and easy to pronounce and took number to take the time to listen to some other podcasts that are similar in topic and find ways that you can bring your secret sauce and that you can be different and stand out. I like to make a list of what I like about the podcast. And what I don't like about the podcast bad. We don't want you to get discouraged. If you find that their other podcast doing. While you're thinking about doing remember that this is your podcast and you're going to bring your personality and your creativity, and your uniqueness to this project. If it make a list of all of your passions and all of the topics you be interested in covering sometimes, it's good to make sure that you have a topic, you can talk about 4 hours. Jean and that you would never get bored of and make a list of all of those things that can be really helpful for coming up with episode ideas. And for your podcast idea in general. Do you know what you guys are planning? And if you need more help with finding the right topic for you, I have this video right here taking you through the exact steps. I take my clients and students to find the right topic for them. Now, that suck about the different ways. You can start your podcast so you can decide which one is right for you. Number one. You can start your podcast, using your smartphone really popular option that a lot of people are getting into podcast using, we recommend to apps for this that you can get on your smartphone, either Apple or Android phones and that is Anchor FM or spreaker studio. And then from there, distributed to the different podcast, directories have a lot of really cool options and little bells and whistles on them. The anchor app is our favorite and it allows you to do minor edits. You can cut out big Songs in the middle of your performance. If it wasn't good. You can also trim the beginning in the end, but that's about it with the editing. So it's important to know that you're not really going to be able to do any advanced editing or any kind of professional editing or control any of this accuser, the compression or any of that fancy professional stuff actually on your phone and you can imagine the microphones on your phone aren't as great sounding as some of the professional podcasting microphone. There were this is a good solution. If you are new to podcasting and you don't want to invest a lot of money and equipment and you're not sure if I cuss in his you're saying. So this is a low-risk glow investment way for you to start your project and you actually be surprised with the results. You can get the other really cool thing about the anchor app is it comes with a bunch of royalty free music, you can use and it's owned by Spotify. So right, when you publish your first episode usually within minutes your podcast will go live on Spotify songs. You can plug into your smartphone to make the sound quality even better. The whole playlist that we did all about smartphone podcasting that you can find right here. If you think this is the option that you want to start with and that's using your computer and are using my car. Yeah, and this is probably the most popular option for independent podcasters because USB microphones, are affordable, and they sound really good and you don't need to get an audio interface. All you have to do is plug them into your computer and you're ready to go to our big to recommendations for. USB microphones. Are the stamps and cute to you and the Audio Technica. Atr2100 X. Both of these are great sounding microphones and they're also upgradeable when we move on to option number 3, which were not to you. And in addition to a USB microphone. You are also going to need to download an audio editing software onto your computer. There's a lot of different options ranging from 32, very expensive here by all-around best. Top choice for independent podcasters is Reaper and you could download Reaper for free and try it free for 60 days in It's a one-time $60 after that and a lot of people recommend audacity, which is a free diw, but I would really recommend that you steer clear from audacity. It really just causes a lot of headache and it's worth the $60 to just get a better be a w from the beginning. If you're stuck and and really want to stick to a free option. I would say garage bands better than even better than GarageBand would be Pro Tools first, but Pro Tools, first takes a lot longer to learn then Reaper. So the way you set this up is pretty simple. In this illustration here Veronica's, using the Samson q2u. She's going to plug it directly into the computer. Then all she has to do is open up Reaper set up a track and press record. When she's done recording. She can press stop. She can add her cording. She can make all sorts of advanced. She can add music, and then, finally, she can export this recording as an MP3 to share with her podcast host. Spell, technically challenged and I learned how to edit a podcast. And I've seen my students and clients learning how to edit their own Pockets. You're just going to have to take a few hours to get familiar with how it works. And it first, they can seem like you're moving so slow and it could be painful and you want to pull out your hair, but just stick with it a little practice and you will be up and running in no time. I spent many years teaching people how to use the dfw's and I've developed a really fun learning style that cuts through all the BS and just teaches you what you need to know right now to get started. We have some videos here on our Channel, you can watch about Reaper and I also put together a free 40-minute training, all about editing a podcast and getting going in reverse. If you can find that by going to Pottstown School, training and grab your seat for that free training option. Number three, you can use an XLR microphone and an audio interface, and this is where we get into professional podcasting. People being intimidated by podcasting. Not that complicated. Once you break it down. So the first thing you're going to need is an XLR microphone. We call it an XLR microphone because that's the output of the microphone is an XLR cable is what you would plug into it. For this. We have to top picks for those on a budget. We really liked the shirt sm58. Is that classic vocal microphone? And the next we really liked the shirt sm7b. This is a really classic podcasting microphone used by many professional podcasters. Once you've chosen the microphone, then you'll need to choose an audio interface. There are tons of audio interfaces. Many that sound really good. Ranging from pretty cheap to very expensive. But my top recommendation for podcasters of all budgets is the focusrite Scarlett to I to this has two inputs. You can record two microphones at the same time, but Scarlett also has a single in the option. That's even cheaper. If you know that you're only ever going to be using one microphone or has it for him. Put option. If you're going to be using more than two microphones do in this illustration Veronica is going to use the Scarlet to I-20 and simply plug. Into the USB input on her computer. Now all she needs to do is plug a microphone into the focusrite. So she'll use an XLR cable. Put one end into the microphone and the other end of the cable Shield plug into the Focus. Right? And you'll see she chose input number one and right next to input. Number one. There's a game knob this knob allows us to adjust the volume or the gain of the microphone. Usually with Dynamic microphones. We're going to want to crank this knob pretty much as high as it goes. And that's a good place to start. Now much like she did with the USB microphone. All she has to do is open up Reaper, set up, a track and press record, and she's recording some sweet podcast vocals, for our last option. Video podcasting, video podcasting is becoming more and more popular among podcasters. You are already recording your voice and you have your podcast episode. The only thing you need to do is two out of camera. This will allow you to record different videos that can go on different platforms. They can go here on YouTube or on your social media and it's the ultimate con. Repurposing for your bike at the episode. Yes, but this is also the most complex way to podcast, but we couldn't let you go without telling you more about it. So this really just requires three more elements to your podcast, set up. The first one like Veronica mentioned, is it camera? Most people will start with just using the camera on their phone. We have very impressive cameras on our phones nowadays or the camera on your laptop or on your computer. And then you can upgrade to a webcam or a more professional camera. Then you're also going to want to pick up some lighting. We really liked reading, Lights, ring, life, blacked, out of the Shadows, off your face, and help you to look more youthful and beautiful. And I can help you feel more confident on camera. And then after that, you're also going to need to pick up some video editing software to actually be able to edit the video together, but it's a great way like Veronica said, to repurpose your podcast and it can be a bit intimidating. It's a great option, but we don't want you to get too overwhelmed with recording your pockets and recording video at the same time. Special, leave your new to both.
